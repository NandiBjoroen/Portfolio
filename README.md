### Projects
#### Clinical Diagnostics: Two-Stage Convolutional Neural Network Model For Lung Cancer Detection
Developed a two-stage convolutional neural network machine learning model whose implementation enables an automated detection and classification of lung cancer subtypes once detected. Early detection and classification is the fundamental basis for a good prognosis in patients with lung cancer. With the multitude of challenges faced in the radiologic interpretation of CT-Scan images such as time, precision, domain knowledge and expertise as well as resources, this project serves as an efficient and effective non-human intervention solution. The model is implemented by combining a binary and multi-class CNN classifier in which the output of the first classifier is utilized as input for classification in the second stage of the model. This results in instant classification and detection of lung cancer using CT-Scan images. The proposed model achieves an 88% accuracy, a macro average f1-score of 83%, and an average weighted f1-score of 89% using the Kaggle â€™Chest CT-Scan images Dataset.
